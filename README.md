# Android-Code-Challenge

`challenge status: open`

## What You'll need to build
Write an Android application with a library project (SDK) using Java. Only the library project should make an HTTP GET request to http://private-d847e-demoresponse.apiary-mock.com/questions 

Once loaded, the library project should at least randomly select one object from the response and generate a View/ViewGroup with text or image. Add features as you like, use your imagination, but coding standard and overall architecture will have the highest value.

###The Library Project should handle the following,
* sending the request 
* parsing the response 
* view generation

###The Android App,
* integrate the library project 
* display the content

##Constraints
* No 3rd party library can be used.
* No 3rd party app development frameworks can be used ( e.g PhoneGap, etc..)

##Bonus Points
At Smaato, we do our best to go the extra mile and as such you would receive bonus points if
* Let the Library project create the View(s) and Android App display the generated View. 
* Export the Library project as a jar or aapt file.
* Usage of Unit Testing framework like Robolectric etc.
* UI testing using UIAutomator / Espresso etc.

##Deliverables
* Android Studio project with source code
* Integration steps if created a Library jar/aapt and if needed.

##API Response Format
A JSON array representing image or text information along with user name and country. The response is NOT case sensitive.

###Image Object Format
```java
     
{
"created": -449280, /* number of seconds passed since created */ "type": "IMG",
"data": { "url": "https://pixabay.com/xxxx"},
"user" : {
"name": "John", "country":"USA" }
}

 ```
###Text Object Format
```java

{
"created": -280800, /* number of seconds passed since created */ "type": "TEXT",
"data": {
"text": "The real danger is not that computers will begin to think like men, but that
men will begin to think like computers."
} "user": {
"name": "Sydney Harris", "country":"USA"
}
}

 ```
 
 
###Note
Please note that the JSON array might have invalid or incomplete object e.g.
```java

{
"created": 0
}

 ```
